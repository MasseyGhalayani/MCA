## MCA Introduction
<img src='assets/MCA.png' width='600'>

MCA is a purely mathematical method applying Attention Mechanism from each directions of two features. In the field of EEG emotion analysis, we are the first to propose a pure mathematical fusion method, coupled with customized 3D-CNN, to accomplish the task of feature fusion.

## Datasets
To acquire the original datasets, please refer to the official website of [DEAP](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html). We used the preprocess method from open-source repository [DEAP_MNE_preprocessing](https://github.com/gzoumpourlis/DEAP_MNE_preprocessing). And we finally got the preprocessed datasets, which can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRQRbRgTIZEDByQYz41CuoyzPe45hxHv?usp=drive_link).

## Get Started

**Installation**
``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate MCA-EEG
```

**Train**

Download the preprocessed datasets and put them under the implementation directory. Then, open the `mca_experiment.ipynb` and modify the path to your data directory. Run the notebook to train the model.

**Test**

Specify the validation type in the `mca_validations.ipynb` and run the notebook to test the model. You can get confusion matrix and accuracy.
``` python
# The default validation type is 'valence', change to validate others
# ['valence', 'arousal', 'dominance', 'liking']
validation_type = 'arousal'
```
